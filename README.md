## Overview

TRACE is a desktop application for exploring and understanding software projects. (Prototpye - not finished product)

Open a local project or clone a public GitHub repository, browse project files, inspect source code, preview images, review documentation, analyze dependencies, and understand repository structure from a modern desktop interface.

### AI Analysis (Digital Forensics & Repository Intelligence)
Available from the new
**AI Analysis** section of the sidebar once a project is opened:

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🧠 Repository Summary | Gemini-powered overview: purpose, framework, languages, entry point, architecture, folder structure, key files, dependencies. |
| 📄 Explain File | Explains the currently selected file's purpose, functions, classes, execution flow, bugs, and possible improvements. |
| 💬 Repository Chat | Ask questions about the codebase ("What starts the application?", "Where is auth handled?"). Only relevant files are sent to Gemini, never the whole repo. |
| 🛡️ Threat Scan | Static regex scan for dangerous APIs (`eval`, `exec`, `os.system`, `pickle.loads`, sockets, PowerShell invocation, registry access, etc.), optionally paired with an AI analyst summary. |
| 🔑 Secret Scan | Static regex scan for exposed credentials (AWS/Google/Gemini keys, JWTs, private keys, passwords, bearer tokens, DB connection strings). |
| 📋 Generate Report | Combines the summary, risk score (0-100), and both scans into a Markdown report you can export. |

**Setup:** the AI features need a Gemini API key. Kindly make a file called "gemini_key.txt" in base-dir and paste your api-key there
